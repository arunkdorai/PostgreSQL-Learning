In this video, the instructor explains **LEFT JOIN** in PostgreSQL, which is used to combine records from two tables while ensuring that all records from the left table are included, even if there are no matching records in the right table. Here's a summary of the key points:

### Key Concepts of LEFT JOIN

1. **Definition**:
   - A LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table (Table A) and the matching rows from the right table (Table B). If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.

2. **Purpose**:
   - LEFT JOIN is useful for retrieving all records from one table along with any matching records from another table, allowing you to see records that may not have a relationship.

### Steps to Perform a LEFT JOIN

1. **Basic LEFT JOIN Syntax**:
   - To include all persons, even those without cars, the syntax is:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM person
     LEFT JOIN car ON person.car_id = car.id;
     ```

2. **Executing the Query**:
   - When executed, this query will show all persons. For those without cars (like Adriana), the car-related fields will return NULL.

3. **Identifying Records Without Relationships**:
   - You can easily find out which persons donâ€™t own a car by using a WHERE clause:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM person
     LEFT JOIN car ON person.car_id = car.id
     WHERE car.id IS NULL;
     ```

4. **Summary of Results**:
   - The LEFT JOIN includes both individuals with and without cars, highlighting the flexibility of this join type to gather comprehensive data.

### Practical Example

- The instructor illustrates how LEFT JOIN allows you to see all persons and their cars (if they have any). This can help identify individuals like Adriana, who have no associated car records.

### Conclusion

- LEFT JOIN is a powerful tool in SQL that helps you retrieve comprehensive datasets by including all records from the primary table, regardless of whether there is a corresponding entry in the related table.
