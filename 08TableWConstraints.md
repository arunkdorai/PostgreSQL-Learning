Adding constraints to the PostgreSQL table:

1. **Constraints Overview**:
   - Constraints enforce rules on data when inserting records.
   - Current table allows inserting records without required information.

2. **Improving the Table**:
   - Use constraints to ensure certain fields must be provided.

3. **Data Types and Constraints**:
   - Change `ID` to `BIGSERIAL`:
     - Automatically increments and serves as the primary key.
     - Use `NOT NULL` to ensure an ID must be present.
   - For `first_name`, `last_name`, `gender`, and `date_of_birth`, specify:
     - Data type (e.g., `VARCHAR(50)`, `VARCHAR(7)`, `DATE`).
     - Use `NOT NULL` for these fields to ensure they are provided.

4. **Nullable Columns**:
   - Some columns can be optional (nullable), like `email`:
     - Use `VARCHAR(150)` and leave it as nullable since not everyone has an email.

5. **Dropping the Table**:
   - Use the command: `DROP TABLE person` to remove the old table before creating the new one.

6. **Creating the New Table**:
   - Use the following SQL command to create the improved table:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE person (
       ID BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
       first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
       last_name VARCHAR(52) NOT NULL,
       gender VARCHAR(7) NOT NULL,
       date_of_birth DATE NOT NULL,
       email VARCHAR(150)  -- Nullable
     );
     ```

7. **Checking Table Structure**:
   - After creation, use `\d person` to see the updated structure of the table, including constraints.

8. **Sequence for Auto Increment**:
   - The `BIGSERIAL` type automatically creates a sequence to manage unique IDs.
