Here’s a summary of the key points for getting started with PostgreSQL:

### Setting Up PostgreSQL on Windows

1. **Install PostgreSQL**: Ensure PostgreSQL is installed on your Windows machine.

2. **Launch PSQL (Interactive Shell)**:
   - Click on the PSQL shortcut to open the command line interface.

3. **Connect to Database**:
   - **Server**: Enter `localhost` to connect to the local server.
   - **Database**: By default, use the database named `Postgres`.
   - **Port**: Default is `5432`.
   - **Username**: Default is `Postgres`.
   - **Password**: Enter the password you set during installation.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - If you attempt to connect to a non-existent database (e.g., `test`), you will receive an error indicating that the database does not exist.

5. **Using PG Admin (Graphical Interface)**:
   - Open PG Admin and connect by entering the same password.
   - You can view your databases and their contents.

### Course Focus
- The course will primarily utilize PSQL (the shell) rather than PG Admin (the GUI).
- Commands will be consistent across different operating systems (Windows and Mac).

To connect PostgreSQL to PowerShell, follow these steps:

### 1. Install PostgreSQL
Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed on your machine, including the command-line tools.

### 2. Open PowerShell
- Press `Windows + X` and select **Windows PowerShell** (or simply search for "PowerShell" in the Start menu).

### 3. Add PostgreSQL to the PATH (if necessary)
If PostgreSQL's `bin` directory isn't in your system PATH, you need to add it:

- Find the installation directory, usually something like:
  ```
  C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\<version>\bin
  ```
- To add it temporarily, run the following command in PowerShell:
  ```powershell
  $env:Path += ";C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\<version>\bin"
  ```
- To add it permanently, you can update the system environment variables through the Control Panel or use PowerShell commands.

### 4. Connect to PostgreSQL using PSQL
1. **Open PowerShell**.
2. **Run the PSQL Command**:
   ```powershell
   psql -U postgres -h localhost -d postgres
   ```
   - Replace `postgres` with your username if different.
   - Replace `localhost` with the server address if connecting remotely.
   - Replace `postgres` at the end with your desired database name.

3. **Enter Password**: When prompted, enter the password for the user.

### Example
Here’s how it looks:
```powershell
psql -U postgres -h localhost -d postgres
Password for user postgres:
```

### 5. Basic Commands in PSQL
Once connected, you can run basic SQL commands:
- To list databases:
  ```sql
  \l
  ```
- To connect to a different database:
  ```sql
  \c database_name
  ```
- To exit PSQL:
  ```sql
  \q
  ```

### Notes
- Ensure PostgreSQL server is running before attempting to connect.
- If you encounter any issues, check the PostgreSQL logs for error messages.
