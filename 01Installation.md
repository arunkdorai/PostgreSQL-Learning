### Setting Up PostgreSQL on Windows

1. **Install PostgreSQL**: Ensure PostgreSQL is installed on your Windows machine.

2. **Launch PSQL (Interactive Shell)**:
   - Click on the PSQL shortcut to open the command line interface.

3. **Connect to Database**:
   - **Server**: Enter `localhost` to connect to the local server.
   - **Database**: By default, use the database named `Postgres`.
   - **Port**: Default is `5432`.
   - **Username**: Default is `Postgres`.
   - **Password**: Enter the password you set during installation.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - If you attempt to connect to a non-existent database (e.g., `test`), you will receive an error indicating that the database does not exist.

5. **Using PG Admin (Graphical Interface)**:
   - Open PG Admin and connect by entering the same password.
   - You can view your databases and their contents.

### Course Focus
- The course will primarily utilize PSQL (the shell) rather than PG Admin (the GUI).
- Commands will be consistent across different operating systems (Windows and Mac).
