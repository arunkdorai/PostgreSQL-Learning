### Key Points for Using the `GROUP BY` Keyword in PostgreSQL

1. **Purpose**:
   - The `GROUP BY` clause is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows, allowing for aggregate calculations.

2. **Example Use Case**:
   - Useful for analyzing datasets by categories, such as counting the number of individuals from different countries.

3. **Basic Syntax**:
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name, COUNT(*)
   FROM table_name
   GROUP BY column_name;
   ```

4. **Finding Unique Countries**:
   - To list unique countries in the dataset:
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT country_of_birth FROM person;
   ```

5. **Counting People by Country**:
   - To count how many individuals belong to each country:
   ```sql
   SELECT country_of_birth, COUNT(*) 
   FROM person 
   GROUP BY country_of_birth;
   ```

6. **Sorting Results**:
   - To order the output based on country names or counts:
   ```sql
   SELECT country_of_birth, COUNT(*) 
   FROM person 
   GROUP BY country_of_birth 
   ORDER BY country_of_birth;
   ```

7. **Important Notes**:
   - All selected columns must either be in the `GROUP BY` clause or used in an aggregate function.
   - Aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, and `AVG()` can be applied to grouped data.

8. **Practical Application**:
   - This method helps generate statistics and insights from your data, making it easier to understand trends and distributions.

9. **Example**:
   - To get a count of people from each country:
   ```sql
   SELECT country_of_birth, COUNT(*) AS number_of_people
   FROM person 
   GROUP BY country_of_birth 
   ORDER BY number_of_people DESC;
   ```
