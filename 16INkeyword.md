Using the `IN` keyword for filtering data:

1. **Selecting Multiple Values**:
   - To select records based on multiple values, you can use the `OR` operator:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM person 
     WHERE country_of_birth = 'China' 
     OR country_of_birth = 'France' 
     OR country_of_birth = 'Brazil';
     ```

2. **Using the IN Keyword**:
   - The `IN` keyword simplifies queries that check for multiple values, reducing redundancy:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM person 
     WHERE country_of_birth IN ('China', 'France', 'Brazil');
     ```

3. **Benefits of IN**:
   - Makes the query cleaner and easier to read.
   - Simplifies adding more countries; you can just add to the list:
     ```sql
     WHERE country_of_birth IN ('China', 'France', 'Brazil', 'Mexico', 'Portugal', 'Niger');
     ```

4. **Sorting Results**:
   - You can order the results based on the country of birth:
     ```sql
     ORDER BY country_of_birth;
     ```

5. **Example Result**:
   - The query returns all individuals from the specified countries, neatly organized.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The `IN` keyword is a powerful tool for filtering results with multiple conditions, enhancing query efficiency and readability.
