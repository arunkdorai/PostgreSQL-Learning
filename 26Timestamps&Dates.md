### Using Dates in PostgreSQL

1. **Importance of Dates**:
   - Dates are essential for recording timestamps (e.g., when a record was created or updated).

2. **Getting the Current Timestamp**:
   - Use the `NOW()` function to retrieve the current timestamp, which includes the date, time, and timezone:
     ```sql
     SELECT NOW();
     ```

3. **Extracting the Date**:
   - To get only the date from the timestamp, cast it to a date type:
     ```sql
     SELECT NOW()::date;
     ```

4. **Extracting the Time**:
   - To get only the time from the timestamp, cast it to a time type:
     ```sql
     SELECT NOW()::time;
     ```

5. **PostgreSQL Date and Time Types**:
   - PostgreSQL offers various date and time types, including:
     - `timestamp` (with or without timezone)
     - `date`
     - `time` (with or without timezone)
     - `interval`
   - Documentation is available for further details on these types: [PostgreSQL Date and Time Types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/datatype-datetime.html).

6. **Using Timestamps**:
   - When creating a timestamp, you can specify whether it includes a timezone or not by using:
     ```sql
     TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
     ```
   - or
     ```sql
     TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE
     ```

   - In the next video, useful date functions will be introduced to enhance your date manipulation skills.




## Manipulating dates in PostgreSQL, focusing on adding and subtracting intervals:

### Manipulating Dates in PostgreSQL

1. **Current Timestamp**:
   - Use the `NOW()` function to get the current timestamp:
     ```sql
     SELECT NOW();
     ```

2. **Subtracting Time Intervals**:
   - To subtract time from the current date, use the `INTERVAL` keyword:
     - Subtract one year:
       ```sql
       SELECT NOW() - INTERVAL '1 year';
       ```
     - Subtract ten years:
       ```sql
       SELECT NOW() - INTERVAL '10 years';
       ```
     - Subtract ten months:
       ```sql
       SELECT NOW() - INTERVAL '10 months';
       ```
     - Subtract ten days:
       ```sql
       SELECT NOW() - INTERVAL '10 days';
       ```

3. **Adding Time Intervals**:
   - Similarly, to add time, use the `+` operator:
     - Add ten days:
       ```sql
       SELECT NOW() + INTERVAL '10 days';
       ```
     - Add ten months:
       ```sql
       SELECT NOW() + INTERVAL '10 months';
       ```

4. **Casting to Date**:
   - If you want to retrieve only the date part, you can cast the entire timestamp:
     ```sql
     SELECT (NOW() - INTERVAL '10 years')::date;
     ```
   - This will return just the date without the time component.

5. **Returning Only the Date**:
   - When casting, ensure to wrap the whole expression in parentheses to avoid issues:
     ```sql
     SELECT (NOW() - INTERVAL '10 years')::date;
     ```

6. **Use Cases**:
   - These operations are useful for performing calculations related to date manipulations, such as finding the date of a previous event or predicting future dates.


## Extracting specific values from a date in PostgreSQL:

### Extracting Date Components in PostgreSQL

1. **Using the `EXTRACT` Function**:
   - The `EXTRACT` function allows you to retrieve specific parts of a timestamp.

2. **Extracting the Year**:
   - To extract the year from the current timestamp:
     ```sql
     SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM NOW());
     ```

3. **Extracting the Month**:
   - To extract the month:
     ```sql
     SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM NOW());
     ```

4. **Extracting the Day**:
   - To extract the day of the month:
     ```sql
     SELECT EXTRACT(DAY FROM NOW());
     ```

5. **Extracting the Day of the Week**:
   - To extract the day of the week (where Sunday is 0):
     ```sql
     SELECT EXTRACT(DOW FROM NOW());
     ```

6. **Extracting the Century**:
   - To extract the century:
     ```sql
     SELECT EXTRACT(CENTURY FROM NOW());
     ```

7. **Additional Components**:
   - You can also extract other components like hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds using similar syntax.

8. **Use Cases**:
   - Extracting date components is useful for reporting, data analysis, and filtering data based on specific time periods.

9. **Conclusion**:
   - This function provides a straightforward way to work with and analyze date values in PostgreSQL.
