### Unique Identification in Tables

1. **Problem of Duplicate Records**:
   - Example: Two individuals with identical values for first name, last name, gender, date of birth, and similar email addresses.
   - Challenge: No single column can uniquely identify each record.

2. **Importance of Primary Keys**:
   - Primary Key: A column (or set of columns) that uniquely identifies each record in a table.
   - Real-world analogy: Unique identifiers like passport numbers distinguish individuals.

3. **Example of Identifying Records**:
   - In the case of the two women, a unique identifier (like a passport number) is needed to differentiate between them.

4. **Data Types for Primary Keys**:
   - Commonly used data types: Numbers (e.g., integers).
   - Recommendation: Use a sequence to manage primary key values.

5. **Suggested Data Type**:
   - `bigserial`: A data type in PostgreSQL that auto-generates unique identifiers.

### Conclusion
- The next steps involve learning how to work with primary keys effectively in PostgreSQL.



### Working with Primary Keys

1. **Creating the Person Table**:
   - Example command:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE person (
         id BIGSERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
         ...
     );
     ```
   - The `id` column is set as the primary key, uniquely identifying each person.

2. **Understanding `BIGSERIAL`**:
   - `BIGSERIAL` automatically generates unique IDs using a sequence.
   - This means the IDs are auto-incremented without manual management.

3. **Inserting Records**:
   - Attempting to insert a record with an existing ID (e.g., `1`) will result in a violation of the unique constraint:
     ```
     ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "person_key"
     ```

4. **Primary Key Constraint**:
   - The primary key ensures that each record can be uniquely identified, similar to how a passport number works for individuals.

5. **Dropping the Primary Key Constraint**:
   - To allow duplicate IDs (not recommended), you can drop the primary key constraint:
     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE person DROP CONSTRAINT person_key;
     ```

6. **Inserting Duplicates After Dropping the Constraint**:
   - After dropping the primary key constraint, inserting a record with an existing ID works:
     ```sql
     INSERT INTO person (id, ...) VALUES (1, ...);
     ```

7. **Consequences of Not Having a Primary Key**:
   - Without a primary key, two records can have the same ID, making it impossible to uniquely identify them.

8. **Conclusion**:
   - Primary keys are essential for maintaining data integrity and uniqueness within a table.

### Next Steps
- In the next video, the focus will be on adding the primary key constraint back and discussing its implications.




### Adding a Primary Key Constraint

1. **Recap of Previous Actions**:
   - Two records with the same ID were added after dropping the primary key constraint.

2. **Attempting to Add a Primary Key**:
   - To add a primary key back to the `person` table:
     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE person ADD PRIMARY KEY (id);
     ```
   - This command will fail if the IDs are not unique.

3. **Why Adding a Primary Key Fails**:
   - If there are duplicate values (e.g., two people with ID `1`), the command will result in an error.
   - The error occurs because primary keys require unique values.

4. **Deleting Duplicate Records**:
   - To fix the issue, duplicates must be removed. Use the following command:
     ```sql
     DELETE FROM person WHERE id = 1;
     ```
   - This command deletes all records with ID `1`.

5. **Verifying Deletion**:
   - After deletion, querying the table for ID `1` should return zero rows:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM person WHERE id = 1;
     ```

6. **Reinserting a Unique Record**:
   - Insert a new record with a unique ID:
     ```sql
     INSERT INTO person (id, ...) VALUES (1, ...);
     ```

7. **Successfully Adding the Primary Key**:
   - After ensuring the ID column is unique, you can re-add the primary key:
     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE person ADD PRIMARY KEY (id);
     ```
   - This time, it works because there are no duplicates.

8. **Confirming the Primary Key**:
   - You can describe the table to verify that the primary key has been successfully added:
     ```sql
     \d person
     ```

### Conclusion
- Always ensure that the column designated as a primary key is unique across all records before adding the constraint.
