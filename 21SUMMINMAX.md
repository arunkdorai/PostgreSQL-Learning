### Key Points for Using Aggregate Functions: `SUM`, `MAX`, and `MIN`

1. **Purpose of Aggregate Functions**:
   - Aggregate functions are used to perform calculations on a set of values, returning a single value.

2. **Common Aggregate Functions**:
   - **`SUM()`**: Calculates the total sum of a numeric column.
   - **`MAX()`**: Finds the maximum value in a column.
   - **`MIN()`**: Finds the minimum value in a column.

3. **Creating a Table for Practice**:
   - Create a table called `car` with the following fields:
     - `ID`: Integer, Primary Key.
     - `make`: String (Car Make), max length 200.
     - `model`: String (Car Model), max length 200.
     - `price`: Numeric (with precision 19, scale 2).
   - Ensure the `price` is within a reasonable range (e.g., $10,000 to $100,000).

4. **Sample SQL for Table Creation**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE car (
       ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       make VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
       model VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
       price NUMERIC(19, 2) NOT NULL
   );
   ```

5. **Inserting Data**:
   - Use a SQL file to populate the table with data.
   - Example command to execute the SQL file in psql:
     ```sql
     \i /path/to/your/car.sql
     ```

6. **Using Aggregate Functions**:
   - Once the `car` table is populated, you can run queries to use the aggregate functions.
   - Example queries:
     - **Total Price of All Cars**:
       ```sql
       SELECT SUM(price) AS total_price FROM car;
       ```
     - **Most Expensive Car**:
       ```sql
       SELECT MAX(price) AS highest_price FROM car;
       ```
     - **Cheapest Car**:
       ```sql
       SELECT MIN(price) AS lowest_price FROM car;
       ```

7. **Documentation**:
   - For more information on aggregate functions, you can refer to the PostgreSQL documentation: [PostgreSQL Aggregate Functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/functions-aggregate.html).

8. **Next Steps**:
   - In the next video, youâ€™ll see practical examples of using `SUM`, `MAX`, and `MIN` with the `car` table.



### Key Points for Finding Car Prices Using Aggregate Functions

1. **Finding the Most Expensive Car**:
   - Use the `MAX()` function to find the highest price in the `car` table:
     ```sql
     SELECT MAX(price) FROM car;
     ```
   - This query returns the most expensive car, which is close to $100,000.

2. **Finding the Cheapest Car**:
   - Use the `MIN()` function to find the lowest price:
     ```sql
     SELECT MIN(price) FROM car;
     ```
   - This returns the minimum car price, which is around $10,000.

3. **Calculating the Average Car Price**:
   - Use the `AVG()` function to find the average price:
     ```sql
     SELECT AVG(price) FROM car;
     ```
   - The average price is approximately $55,000.

4. **Rounding Values**:
   - To round the average price, use the `ROUND()` function:
     ```sql
     SELECT ROUND(AVG(price)) FROM car;
     ```
   - This outputs a nicely rounded average value, such as $55,257.

5. **Grouping by Make and Finding Minimum Price**:
   - To find the minimum price for each car make, use `GROUP BY`:
     ```sql
     SELECT make, MIN(price) FROM car GROUP BY make;
     ```
   - This gives you the minimum price for each make.

6. **Finding Maximum Price by Make**:
   - To find the maximum price for each make, you can similarly adjust the query:
     ```sql
     SELECT make, MAX(price) FROM car GROUP BY make;
     ```

7. **Dropping the Model**:
   - If you're only interested in the make, you can exclude the model from your `SELECT` statement:
     ```sql
     SELECT make, MAX(price) FROM car GROUP BY make;
     ```

8. **Finding Average Price by Make**:
   - To find the average price for each make:
     ```sql
     SELECT make, AVG(price) FROM car GROUP BY make;
     ```
   - To round these average prices, you can use:
     ```sql
     SELECT make, ROUND(AVG(price)) FROM car GROUP BY make;
     ```
