### Key Points for Using the `HAVING` Keyword in PostgreSQL

1. **Purpose**:
   - The `HAVING` clause is used to filter records after aggregation, typically in conjunction with the `GROUP BY` clause.

2. **Basic Syntax**:
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name, COUNT(*)
   FROM table_name
   GROUP BY column_name
   HAVING COUNT(*) [condition];
   ```

3. **When to Use**:
   - Use `HAVING` when you want to filter groups created by `GROUP BY`. It allows for conditions on aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, etc.

4. **Example Use Case**:
   - To find countries with at least five individuals:
   ```sql
   SELECT country_of_birth, COUNT(*) 
   FROM person 
   GROUP BY country_of_birth 
   HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5;
   ```

5. **Ordering Results**:
   - You can sort the results after filtering:
   ```sql
   SELECT country_of_birth, COUNT(*) 
   FROM person 
   GROUP BY country_of_birth 
   HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5 
   ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
   ```

6. **Filtering by Aggregate Functions**:
   - You can specify different conditions, such as:
   - **More than 40**:
     ```sql
     HAVING COUNT(*) > 40;
     ```
   - **Less than or equal to 180**:
     ```sql
     HAVING COUNT(*) <= 180;
     ```

7. **Aggregate Functions**:
   - Common aggregate functions include:
     - `COUNT()`: Counts the number of rows.
     - `SUM()`: Calculates the total sum of a numeric column.
     - `AVG()`: Computes the average of a numeric column.
     - `MAX()`, `MIN()`: Finds the maximum and minimum values, respectively.

8. **Documentation**:
   - For more functions and details, refer to the PostgreSQL documentation on aggregate functions.

9. **Example**:
   - To find countries with populations greater than 180:
   ```sql
   SELECT country_of_birth, COUNT(*) 
   FROM person 
   GROUP BY country_of_birth 
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 180;
   ```

10. **Conclusion**:
    - The `HAVING` clause is powerful for filtering results after aggregation, making it essential for deriving insights from grouped data.
