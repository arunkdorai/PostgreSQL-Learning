In this video, the instructor demonstrates how to establish a relationship between two tables in PostgreSQL: `person` and `car`. The relationship is defined such that one person can own one car, and each car can belong to only one person. Hereâ€™s a summary of the steps taken:

### Steps to Add a Relationship Between Tables

1. **Dropping Existing Tables**:
   - The instructor begins by dropping the existing `person` and `car` tables to clear any previous data.
   - Command: `DROP TABLE person; DROP TABLE car;`

2. **Creating New Tables**:
   - The instructor provides a downloadable SQL file (`person-car.sql`) to create the new structure for the tables.

3. **Defining the Car Table**:
   - A new column, `car_id`, is added to the `person` table to establish a foreign key relationship. 
   - The data type for `car_id` is specified as `BIGINT`, which is appropriate for referencing IDs.

4. **Adding Foreign Key Reference**:
   - The `car_id` column is defined to reference the `id` column in the `car` table.
   - A unique constraint is added to `car_id` to ensure that a car can be associated with only one person.

5. **Executing SQL Commands**:
   - The instructor mentions executing the SQL commands to create the tables and insert initial data.
   - Ensures that the `car` table is created before attempting to reference it in the `person` table.

6. **Inserting Data**:
   - Once the tables are created, the instructor checks the data by selecting from both tables to confirm that the structures are set up correctly.

7. **Next Steps**:
   - The video concludes by mentioning that the next part will involve assigning a car to a person.

### Summary
This video effectively walks through the process of creating a relationship between two tables using foreign keys in PostgreSQL. It emphasizes the importance of proper table creation and the implications of relationships in relational databases.
