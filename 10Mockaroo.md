### Adding Records and Modifying Tables

1. **Adding a New Column**:
   - To add a new column (e.g., `country_of_birth`), you would typically use an `ALTER TABLE` command. However, in this case, it was added during the data generation phase.

2. **Data Generation**:
   - Using tools like [Mockaroo](https://mockaroo.com), you can generate random data in various formats. 
   - You can specify fields, types, and formats to match your table structure.

3. **Nullable Fields**:
   - When generating data, you can specify that certain fields (like email) can be nullable (i.e., 30% of records can have no email).

4. **SQL File Creation**:
   - After generating data, you can download it as a `.sql` file, which contains commands to create and insert records into your database.

5. **Editing SQL Files**:
   - You can modify the generated SQL file to adjust data types or constraints, like making fields `NOT NULL` or adjusting field sizes.

6. **Executing SQL Files**:
   - Use the `\i` command in psql to execute SQL commands from a file:
     ```sql
     \i /path/to/your/file/person.sql
     ```

7. **Dropping a Table**:
   - Use the `DROP TABLE` command to remove a table:
     ```sql
     DROP TABLE person;
     ```
   - Be cautious with this command in production environments, as it deletes all data in the table.

8. **Creating Tables with a Sequence**:
   - For an auto-incrementing ID, use the `BIGSERIAL` type, which automatically manages ID increments.

9. **Final SQL Execution**:
   - After modifying the table structure and running the insert commands, you can verify the data with:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM person;
     ```

10. **Error Handling**:
    - If you encounter errors about missing columns during insertion, ensure that the table structure matches the insert commands.

### Summary
You learned how to generate a large dataset, modify a table structure, drop and recreate tables, and execute SQL commands from a file. These techniques are essential for managing data effectively in PostgreSQL.
